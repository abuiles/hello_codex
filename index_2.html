    <h1>Best Practices for Using Code</h1>
    <p>Here are a few tips to help keep your code clean and maintainable:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Write clear comments:</strong> Explain the purpose of complex logic so others can understand your work.</li>
        <li><strong>Be consistent with formatting:</strong> Use the same indentation and naming conventions throughout your project.</li>
        <li><strong>Break tasks into functions:</strong> Smaller, reusable functions make your code easier to test and debug.</li>
        <li><strong>Version control:</strong> Use a tool like Git to track changes and collaborate with others.</li>
        <li><strong>Test your code:</strong> Automated tests help ensure your code works as expected as you make changes.</li>
    </ul>

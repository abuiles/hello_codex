This repository contains a minimal static site that can be published with GitHub Pages. `index.html` serves as the entry point and links to `best-practices.html` through a simple navigation menu.

The `.github/workflows/pages.yml` workflow automates deployment so pushing to `main` updates the site automatically.

## Publishing with GitHub Pages

1. Open the repository's **Settings** and locate the **Pages** section.
2. Choose **Deploy from a branch** and select the `main` branch with the root folder.
3. Save the configuration. GitHub will provide the URL where the site is hosted.

Once enabled, navigate to the provided URL to see the site in action.
